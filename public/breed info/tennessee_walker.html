        <p>The breed was developed beginning in the late 18th century when Narragansett Pacers and Canadian Pacers from the eastern 
            United States were crossed with gaited Spanish Mustangs from Texas. Other breeds were later added, and in 1886 a foal 
            named Black Allan was born. He is now considered the foundation sire of the breed. In 1935 the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' 
            Association was formed, and it closed the studbook in 1947.</p>
