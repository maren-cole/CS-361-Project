        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In the 1600s, imported English Thoroughbred horses were first bred with assorted local horses on the Eastern seaboard of colonial
             America. One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus, a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the Godolphin Arabian. 
             He was foaled in 1746, and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756. The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes 
             crucial to the development of the colonial "Quarter Horse". The resulting horse was small, hardy, quick, and was used as a
              work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends.</p>
