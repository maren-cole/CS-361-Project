        <p>The Thoroughbred is a horse breed developed for horse racing. Although the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to
             any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered "hot-blooded" 
             horses that are known for their agility, speed, and spirit. The Thoroughbred, as it is known today, was developed in 17th- 
             and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding.
              All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th and 18th
               centuries, and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. </p>
